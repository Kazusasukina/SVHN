# ConvNet-for-SVHN

IPython notebook for classifying 32x32 pixel Google Street View House Number (SVHN) images
(see http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model 
with a logistic-regression based classifier as the final step.

Gives accuracy of around 88% for <=500 epochs.  More epochs may improve accuracy but it seems to plateau

Adjusting filter widths may have some impact.
